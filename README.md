# Garbage-Classification-Model

# Objective 
This model which help us to classify waste with 7 different waste materials and it will show you the details of that particular waste materials. This will help to raise awareness for people to reduce and recycle waste.

# Overview
There are 'cardboard', 'compost', 'glass', 'metal', 'paper', 'plastic', 'trash' total 7 different types of waste materials which are use for recycling.
Here i have 2187 images belonging 7 classes.
Here i have trained dataset using VGG16,RESNET50 model via using Transfer Learning technique of CNN for classification.
Here i have trained this model till 5 epochs and i got 69.77% accuracy. Since my computer can not aford more epochs at this time due unavailbility of GPU. if you have good ammount of gpu you can train more than 50 epochs.
